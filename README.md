# ExtractionTool

The SecDFD Extraction Tool, or "extraction tool", was developed as part of a master's thesis at the department of 
Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology in the spring of 2019.

The program is written in Python 3.7, and intended for use on Java projects. It is recommended that Doxygen is used
in order to generate the necessary call-graph files. For a guide on how to launch and run the program, please review
the folder titled "Training Material".
